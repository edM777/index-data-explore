    "In this study we will revisit the past exploration of Market Index Price Distributions, which included tests to determine if the distributions are log-normal/normal. According to market theory, share prices are log-normally distributed, so we will test these assumptions.  To see the conclusions of my last study, see the accompanying notebook -  \"[Market Index Data Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/edM777/index-data-explore/blob/main/Market%20Index%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb)\". The same *References* used there also apply here, in addition to any new ones noted.<br>\n",
    "Furthermore, this study expands on the last one by analyzing the normality of index log returns as well as the effects of the Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR). The additional analysis gives more insight into the price evolution of financial instruments and whether or not they behave according to theory.\n"

    "As can be seen above, there are some noticeable differences between the price distributions generated in this study, with data from almost three years into the future. However, all of the histograms do have some characteristics of normal distributions. They have a peak and a bell curve type shape with two tails. This is the case for all time periods, even the longer ones, which does not exactly agree with the statistical tests performed later on. So, these histograms seem to show the same distribution shapes as before, though still different.<br>\n",

    "Already, it can be said that the log returns data yielded interesting results. Here we have 12 cases which pass the test. In our study done almost 3 years ago, only 2 cases passed the test. And we still see a pattern regarding the index and time period: The shorter time periods (60 days) are most likely to pass the test and DAX seems to have the most normally distribution. Conclusions about the price type are not as clear here.  <br>Another aspect worth noting is that all 3 statistical tests here seem to reach similar conclusions, so there isn't one test which disagrees with another. <br><br>Without performing further tests, one might think that log returns tend to be distributed more normally that raw prices, but we will see that the behavior may be the opposite in some cases."

    "As can be seen in the table above, 23 cases passed the normality test when we tested the raw price data. This is almost double the number of passes compared to the log returns tests. The \"top\" 3 results are also the same, with DAX 60 day time periods, and price types 3, 1, and 0. After these, the results differ a bit.<br> In both cases we can definitely still see the same trend of the shorter time periods (60 days and 180 days) being most likely to pass the test. It also still seems as though DAX is the most likely to be normal, as it appears a bit more than the rest.<br>Initially, these results were a bit unexpected. As explained before, I thought that the results would be similar according to the theory. But we can clearly see more passing results when we analyze the raw prices. And again, only smaller time periods pass, so our statistical tests may still have some limitations. So, further testing should be done to validate our results here."

    "We now move on to our visual tests to further analyze the effects of examining log normal returns as opposed to the raw prices. To begin, we plotted a histogram of DAX log returns for all available time, using Price Type 1. This can be considered another \"proof of concept\" for our normality testing. If the whole dataset showed at least some normal characteristics under certain circumstances, then this would also indicate that varying the parameters as before may lead to interesting results. And as discussed above, the initial statistical tests above already support the notion that log returns can yield different results as compared to raw prices when analyzing normality. "

    "As can be seen above, the histograms generated for this sample are noticeably normal and lognormal, respectively. So, even though the log returns statistical tests determined that it's unlikely this sample is normal, the histogram can appear to say otherwise. It's only after closer inspection that you can see the outliers on the right of the graph. It's possible that there are some limitations to the accuracy of these statistical tests. Or, it could be that those outliers are enough to break the definitions of normality.<br>\n",
    "All in all, log returns should be easier to spot being normal due to it being a familiar shape. However, statistical testing may be best in some cases, where things may seem normal, but there are a few outliers that skew the distribution. And it seems these outliers are especially harder to spot when the rest of the distribution looks very normal."

    "As has been mentioned in this report before, an initial interpretation of the mathematical theory behind the log-normal model for stock prices makes it seem as though raw price distributions and log return distributions directly correlate with each other. Again, as the CFA puts it, \"If continuously compounded returns are normally distributed, asset prices are lognormally distributed.\"<sup>6</sup> <br>\n",
    "To be more specific on the theory, Malkiel's random walk model for share prices, with share price $S(t)$, uses the main equation: dS(t) = µ.S(t).dt + σ.S(t).dZ <sup>7</sup>. This is essentially describing the continuous returns of a stock. Then, through derivation, the equivalent discrete share price equation is: S(t) = S(t–1).exp{µ* + σ.Z(t)}. <br>So, we can see how the equations would both yield normal distributions (you would need to perform a log transform on the share price equation) and they directly correlate with each other. <br><br>\n",
    "However, the Central limit Theorem seems to expand on the theory, as a price distribution should eventually be log-normal, even if the log returns are not. In our analysis we even had a case where the log returns appear normal, however the raw price distribution does *not* seem to be normal/log-normal. There are a few possibilities for our results. One interpretation is that the real life index data, at least in this study, is not distributed according to theory at all. However, with some results showing clear indications of normality on both ends, I don't think that's completely accurate. I believe that it may be more often the case that financial instrument prices are more likely to be log-normally distributed than it is for the log returns to be normally distributed.<br>In any case, more tests should be done with many varied samples to make more definite conclusions on these distributions. The most apparent finding in this log returns study simply seems to be that raw price distributions and its log returns distributions do not always correlate with each other. "

    "Up until this point, almost all our raw price datasets have been adjusted by their Compound Average Growth Rate (CAGR). This includes both the \"raw\" price tests and the log returns tests. To calculate the CAGR for each price interval, the standard formula was used: $CAGR = ((fv / pv)^{365/d}) - 1$. See the past study's \"Initial Normality Tests\" section for details and code.<br> \n",
    "This CAGR adjustment was also inspired by the studies done by sixfigureinvesting. According to that study, and other sources, \"the CAGR can be used to smooth returns so that they may be more easily understood\"<sup>8</sup>. After further reflection, a question that came to mind is how does this \"smoothing\" affect normality? Does the CAGR adjustment keep the underlying price distribution the same? This next part of the study explored these questions further."

    "As shown above, we can see the CAGR adjustment did make a noticeable difference. The main difference we can see visually is that it got rid of some outliers, on both sides of the distribution. It's not easy to tell visually which distribution was affected the most, especially at this scale. But the smaller time period distributions seem to have changed the most, as before there was a large gap between the mean and the outliers. The shape of the larger time period seems fairly similar, but now the range is much smaller, as a lot of small outliers seem to have been removed.<br>So, we can see that the CAGR adjustment did do some sort of \"smoothing\" to our dataset. Note, however, that that the overall shape of the distributions remained the same. With no CAGR adjustment, all distributions had a normal bell curve shape, especially the larger time periods. After the adjustment, the distributions were tightened up by removing the outliers. "

    "According to theory, it is already known that the CAGR calculation has some limitations, such as not accounting for volatility.<sup>8</sup>. However, from all our studies done thus far, including the one above, we can see that distributions can still be noticeably different from a normal/log-normal one even with the CAGR adjustment. Indeed, from the histograms generated, it seems the effect of removing some volatility from price histories is that outliers are removed. However, in some cases, even if the outliers are removed, the distribution can be very haphazard. One way to look at this is that the CAGR is a way to remove noise from the signal, but the underlying signal remains the same.<br>\n",
    "It can also be fair to say that only analyzing raw prices is valid, and that any manipulations/adjustments of the data makes results invalid. It seems few other researchers in this area have looked into adjusting by the CAGR. However, our results, when the visual and the statistical tests are taken into account, do make logical sense, even with the CAGR adjustment. It may also be that the CAGR is just another tool that is most useful to use in certain circumstances. In the literature, for example, the CAGR is meant to be used for larger time periods where the compounding growth most affects the price evolution. It would be interesting to explore more in the future how these conditions interact with CAGR adjustments."

    "After this second set of studies, I have more confidence in saying that market index prices can have log-normal distributions under certain conditions. Those conditions can be: the specific time period analyzed, what specific price is used (average price, close price, open, etc), and the index itself (DAX, INDU, SPX, etc). Of course there could be other conditions that could be analyzed in the future, but these are the params we examined which made a difference. "

    "In this study it was also observed that the log-normality/normality of index prices and their log returns are not directly correlated - if log returns are normal, this does not necessarily mean that the raw price distribution is lognormal and vice-versa. It seems that, overall, this behavior is still according to mathematical theory. However, a deeper study on the theory is required to confirm this. In any case, both the returns and the raw prices should be considered when analyzing the distributions of financial instruments.<br>\n",

More samples would need to be analyzed in future studies to make more definitive conclusions.

Overall, it seems that others did not find much evidence for log-normality in the distribution of share prices. The studies also all seem to be conducted differently.

    "Lastly, I would like to mention that the market theory seems to specifically say that *share* prices are log-normally distributed, which should limit the application to Stock prices, and not Indices. However, Indices are composed of stocks, so one might assume that would make indices be included in the theory. Furthermore, other online sources seem to extend the theory to index values as well. In Wilkies' log-normal random walk paper, he shows how the mathematical models make it as though an index cannot be log-normal if its underlying stocks are log-normal<sup>7</sup>. But, because of the CLT, the indices will eventually be log-normal. <br>\n",
